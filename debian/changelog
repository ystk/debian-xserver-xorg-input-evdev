xserver-xorg-input-evdev (1:2.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Timo Aaltonen ]
  * Remove obsolete .manpages.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Actually merge upstream master up to 99340147b9 (one extra commit) to
    avoid inverted horizontal scroll.
  * Don't merge from debian-experimental to avoid picking up XI2.2 fun:
    too many bugs still need fixes so let's keep that for another day.
    That would require a newer input proto package, along with a newer
    server, anyway.
  * Bump xserver-xorg-dev build-dep to 2:1.10, now required.
  * Add libudev-dev build-dep.

xserver-xorg-input-evdev (1:2.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get rid of “[linux-any]” for the dependency on udev-udeb, evdev is
    Linux-only.
  * Replace non-breaking spaces with regular spaces in udeb's long
    description.
  * Switch to dh:
    - Bump debhelper build-dep, add dh-autoreconf build-dep.
    - Bump compat to 8.
    - Rewrite debian/rules.
    - Pass --fail-missing to dh_install.
    - Stop passing --disable-static to configure, that's the default.
  * Bump xserver-xorg-dev build-dep for dh_xsf_substvars and xsf sequence.
  * Remove xsfbs accordingly.
  * Replace ${xserver:Depends} with ${xinpdriver:Depends} in the udeb.
  * Remove long obsolete Replaces.
  * Update Uploaders list. Thanks, David & Brice!
  * Remove build-deps:
    - dpkg-dev is recent enough on stable and higher.
    - automake and libtool are pulled through dh-autoreconf.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes needed).
  * Wrap Depends/Provides.
